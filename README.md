# Zammad Ticket Creator
## Description
Zammad is an open-source, web-based help desk and customer support system. It provides a platform for managing and tracking customer inquiries, tickets, and interactions across various communication channels like email, phone, chat, and social media.
Unfortunately there's no official JavaScript API client. Thus, we've programmed a small adapter to create tickets from our single page applications (e.g. React).

## Usage
```javascript
const ZammadTicketCreator = require("./ZammadTicketCreator");

// use the Url of your Zammad instance
const serverUrl = 'https://your-zammad-instance.com';
// set a fingerprint, a small base64 image, for security reasons
const fingerprint='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASw';
// set a source to let the ticket know where it came from
const source = "Test Form"
// create a new ZammadTicketCreator object and pass the serverUrl, fingerprint and source
const ZammadTicketCreator = new ZammadTicketCreator(serverUrl, fingerprint, source)

// create a new ticket by using the send function. name and email parameter should match 
ZammadTicketCreator.send("Customer Name","test@email.com", {this: "test"})
```
